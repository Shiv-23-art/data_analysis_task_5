## Titanic Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting passenger survival from the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques. It is a classic binary classification task based on the famous Titanic dataset.

## Project Overview

## Objective: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Dataset: Titanic dataset (with features like age, sex, class, etc.)

## Techniques Used:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Key Highlights

Visualization of survival rates by gender, class, and age.

Data cleaning and feature engineering for better model performance.
